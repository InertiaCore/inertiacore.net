# Demo application

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertiacore.com). This application is built using ASP.NET Core and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inertiacore/pingcrm).

The Ping CRM demo is hosted on Heroku and the database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

<!-- TODO: Add Svelte/React versions -->
<!-- In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, we also maintain a Svelte version of the application, which you can find [on GitHub](https://github.com/inertiacore/pingcrm-svelte). -->

## Third party

Beyond our InertiaCore demo app, Ping CRM has also been translated into numerous different languages and frameworks. The list is available [here](https://inertiajs.com/demo-application#third-party).
