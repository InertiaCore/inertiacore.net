# Demo application

We've setup a demo app for Inertia.js called [Ping CRM](https://demo.inertiacore.net). This application is built using ASP.NET Core and Vue. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inertiacore/pingcrm).

The Ping CRM demo is hosted on Heroku and the database is reset every hour. Please be respectful when editing data.

In addition to the Vue version of Ping CRM, we also maintain [React](https://github.com/inertiacore/pingcrm-react) and [Svelte](https://github.com/inertiacore/pingcrm-svelte) versions of the application on GitHub.

## Third party

Beyond our InertiaCore demo app, Ping CRM has also been translated into numerous different languages and frameworks. The list is available [here](https://inertiajs.com/demo-application#third-party).
